# UFPOR_App

To start:

1- Clone the project on you machine 
2- Open it in Intellij IDEA or import it to Eclipse. You cannot use the community version of Intellij since it doesn't have GWT support. 

You need to resolve all the Google App Engine and GWT dependency errors through maven central or by downloading the jar files.

Let me know if you encounter any problem and Good luck!
